# RESTaurant API

## About The Project

RESTaurant API is a table booking application designed to serve both restaurants and customers. Our primary goal is to create a platform that facilitates easy registration and management for restaurants while providing customers with a seamless booking experience.

- Table Management: A user-friendly interface for restaurants to manage their tables.
- Food Services Management: Ability for restaurants to update and manage their food services and menus.

2. For Customers
- Restaurant Browsing: Browse through a list of restaurants available on the platform.
- Table Booking: Easily book tables at restaurants of choice.
